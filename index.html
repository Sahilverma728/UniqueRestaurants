            As with so many ideas that evolve over time, restaurants now serve a larger role in society... they have become places of social contact, of discovering new cultures and tastes from far-away lands, of spending an evening with your loved ones, of clinching business deals over a glass of wine, and so forth. All this, of course, in addition to the basic functions of “restoring” people with the help of good food, service and ambience.
            Restaurants differ based on their orientation towards a certain type of food or beverage, a specialized activity, a particular style of service or a combination of these. For instance a coffee shop is oriented towards coffee and conversation, a discotheque towards dance and liquor, a quick service restaurant towards dishing out pre-prepared food quickly on order, a fine dining restaurant towards a certain kind of cuisine, a takeaway towards delivered packaged meals. Anyone planning to start a restaurant will have to take note of these diverse functions and orientations, and cater to the different (and ever-changing!) needs and expectations of prospective clients.

                            The Grotta Palazzese restaurant is internationally renowned, as evidenced by the many reviews on the most important magazines and blogs around the world. It has an outdoor lounge, set in a unique place in the world. In fact, the terrace that welcomes guests has been created within a natural cave, the "Grotta Palazzese" (or "di Palazzo", as it was once called), from which it takes its name, a place known and used for parties and banquets since 1700. Famous, to regard, it is the watercolor of Jean Louis Desprez of 1783.

                            ION Luxury Adventure Hotel's concrete and glass facade rises from the Icelandic landscape like a set piece in a science fiction fantasy.

                            The SnowCastle of Kemi (Finnish: Kemin lumilinna) is the biggest snow fort in the world. It is rebuilt every winter with a different architecture in Kemi, Finland. In 1996 the first snow castle drew 300,000 visitors. For several years the snowcastle was located in the Kemi city harbor, in 2017 the location was moved into a nearby park. Current address is Mansikkanokankatu 15. The area covered by the castle has varied from 13,000 to over 20,000 square metres. The highest towers have been over 20 metres high and longest walls over 1,000 metres long, and the castle has had up to three stories. Despite its varying configurations, the snow castle has a few recurring elements: a chapel, a restaurant and a hotel.

                            The Labassin Waterfall Restaurant in Philippines is one of the most unusual restaurants as it gives one a chance to dine in the middle of a waterfall! Situated amidst the Villa Escudero Plantations and Resort, this restaurant is one-of-a-kind as it serves authentic seafood on bamboo tables while you enjoy the cool breeze of the surrounding forest and the refreshing waterfall. While coming here you can give your footwear a break and enjoy a scrumptious Filipino platter with your feet dipped in the cold water. You might also get drenched while having your meal, but eating amidst the gushing waterfall is worth an experience which you cannot miss while in the Philippines.

Aside from the dramatic cooking methods, El Diablo also brags an amazing otherworldly panoramic view of Lanzarote’s Timanfaya National Park, a martian landscape of red sands and volcanic rock. This dormant volcano has been peacefully gurgling below the surface since it’s last eruption in 1824. What could possibly go wrong?

Established in May 1991, the restaurant is modeled after a 1950s drive-in theater. Walt Disney Imagineering designed the booths to resemble convertibles of the period, and some servers act as carhops while wearing roller skates. While eating, guests watch a large projection screen displaying clips of 1950s and 1960s films as Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman.

                            This place is much more than a restaurant. It’s a labyrinth of storybook pages, followed by a stack of books that make you feel caterpillar-sized. You enter into the main dining room to see various scenes from Lewis Carroll’s classic novel: the hedges from the Queen’s croquet-ground, enormous cards on the ceiling, and chairs in the shape of rose-bushes. The staff welcomes you in Alice’s pinafore dress and Mad Hatter-inspired costumes.

While there were only six cats present when we visited (the website lists a dozen), they were an extremely lively bunch - running around, jumping in the air, and playing a vigorous game of fetch with a cloth-covered toy. We're not sure, but we suspect that catnip may have been involved. The cafe is attractively furnished in residential living-room style, with windows looking out onto one of Himeji's shopping streets.

                            <br>
                            Fans of the popular TV series "Game of Thrones" can dine like the show's characters at a pop-up restaurant themed around a meeting of the Small Council. HBO has partnered with pop-up organisers The Wandering Chef to create several courses inspired by the Westeros setting, accompanied by cocktails fit for a king. Fans will be given a chance to win a seat at the King's Landing council table and enjoy a night of entertainment, food and drink.

                            <br>
                            The unusual theme of this restaurant is not just a marketing ploy to entice dinners but a reminder for people to value their freedom and stay away from crimes. Let’s just hope this campaign works. Customers walk down dimly-lit corridors lined with brick walls before being "locked up" in iron-barred cells, equipped with shackles and handcuffs. "Inmates" must place their orders on an iPad-menu. The food — a fusion of traditional Chinese and western food - is then passed through a small door hatch.
